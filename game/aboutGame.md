###Game concept

*Dude, where are my tools?* is a type of game with
two-dimensional graphics. The player controls a character
with a space and arrow keys, which allows jumping over
barriers or climbing the ladder between platforms.
The goal is to collect all scattered tools necessary to repair the car.
